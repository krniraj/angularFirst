angularFirst
============

This is the first angular application created by me.

STEPS to start with:

1. Open GitBash and cd to project location
2. Make sure you have NPM, GRUNT, Bower and Yeoman installed. If not Install them.
3. run :
    mkdir angularjs-grunt-example
    yo angular

The package.json file
Yeoman will generate a package.json file (similar to a Gemfile used in Ruby) which will list all project dependencies. 
To install these you can simply run npm install.

Run grunt karma

grunt karma

All tests pass!
